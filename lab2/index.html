          <h2>Nelson Mandera</h2>
          <span>(1918 - 2013)</span>
          <p>Born in Mvezo, Cape Province, South Africa</p>
          <p>
            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid
            revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as
            President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's
            first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
            representative democratic election.

          <h3>Life</h3>
          <p>
            Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of
            Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi
            Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela,
            principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people,
            Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years old, his father
            died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the
            Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.

          <h3>Period in prison</h3>
          <p>
            On 12 August 1988 he was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed
            with tuberculosis. After more than three months in two hospitals he
            was transferred on 7 December 1988 to a house at Victor Verster
            Prison near Paarl where he spent his last 14 months of imprisonment.
            He was released from its gates on Sunday 11 February 1990, nine days
            after the unbanning of the ANC and the PAC and nearly four months
            after the release of his remaining Rivonia comrades. Throughout his
            imprisonment he had rejected at least three conditional offers of
            release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mandela immersed himself in official talks to end white minority
            rule and in 1991 was elected ANC President to replace his ailing
            friend, Oliver Tambo. In 1993 he and President FW de Klerk jointly
            won the Nobel Peace Prize and on 27 April 1994 he voted for the
            first time in his life.

          <h3>Government</h3>
          <p>
            On 10 May 1994 he was inaugurated as South Africa’s first
            democratically elected President. On his 80th birthday in 1998 he
            married Graça Machel, his third wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            True to his promise, Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one term as
            President. He continued to work with the Nelson Mandela Children’s
            Fund he set up in 1995 and established the Nelson Mandela Foundation
            and The Mandela Rhodes Foundation.

          <h3>Novel Prize</h3>
          <p>
            Nelson Mandela shared the Peace Prize with the man who had released
            him, President Frederik Willem de Klerk, because they had agreed on
            a peaceful transition to majority rule.
